# Headless SaaS

Soon to be released:

* Confirmation Service: used for authentication/authorization, registration-less login, and a whole lot more.
* Secure Configuration Service: secure on demand configuration for your SaaS servers, services, apps, and tools.  Providing a centralized secure configuration reducing the need for ENVIRONMENT variables, and preventing security issues associated with storing credentials in source code.&#x20;
* SaaS Account, User, and API Key Management Service: pretty much what you would expect.
* Goals, and Activities Service: more on this when, it is ready for use
